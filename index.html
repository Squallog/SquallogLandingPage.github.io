            <p>
                Hi, I'm Jeremy - a freelance sound recordist and post production mixer based in Greater Manchester.<br>
                I've done post-production for a feature film, I edit a podcast for Colourful Radio, and I produce imaging elements for Gaydio's Manchester station.<br>
                So if you're in Manchester, looking for a sound op, or need an editor, feel free to drop a line or send a message.
            </p>

                Did a really good job in a short time and really improved the sound quality of the current cut of the film ‘Sober’ which is in post-production. Have already spoken to Jeremy about doing some more work further down the line, on Sober and potentially on other productions – would highly recommend him to other industry professionals.

                Very professional in all areas. Jeremy was able to capture the material we required that fit the brief perfectly. We would highly recommend and work with Jeremy for future opportunities.
